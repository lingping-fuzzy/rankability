## Rankability

On the fuzzy entropy and the rankability of data

# Rankability fundamentally differs from ranking: while ranking generates a deterministic order that may shift based on feature importance, rankability quantifies the confidence or stability of that ordering. Assessing the quality of a ranking is difficult, and measuring rankability is even more challenging. Despite its importance in applications such as web search, data mining, cybersecurity, and machine learning, rankability remains largely underexplored. Only a handful of methods have been proposed since the first work by Anderson et al. in 2019, most of which rely on computationally intensive eigenvalue decompositions of large matrices or regression models trained on extensive datasets. This paper presents a novel rankability measure based on entropy and variance—two efficient, interpretable statistical quantities that overcome the computational limitations of existing approaches. Our method enables fast and practical rankability assessment in settings lacking ground truth or consensus standards. We evaluate the proposed measure on football tournament datasets and demonstrate its strong correlation with well-established ranking systems, including the widely used Elo rating. The results show close alignment with these conventional benchmarks, confirming the validity and practical relevance of our approach. As rankability is still an emerging field, this work contributes a computationally efficient and interpretable tool while highlighting the need for continued research to develop more robust analytical methods for evaluating ranking confidence in complex systems.
